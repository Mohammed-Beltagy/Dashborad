# Dashborad Using [ Pug, SCSS ]

## Hello! I'm **_Mohammed Beltagy_**

I choosed this project to do because I learned [ Pug, SCSS, Gulp] recently and I see this a suitable implementaion on these skills.

In this project I has been focused on some specific points to learn:

- Creating components that will be included on each page without rebuilding it again using [Pug] instead of [react]
  => In my opinion it will make learning (how to create single page application with [React]) is easier
- Creating small framework using sass to make a dry code

[Live Site]() - This is my implementation.
